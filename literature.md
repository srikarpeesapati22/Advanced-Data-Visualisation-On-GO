# Use Cases

This document gives general use cases for each type of chart in the Chart Gallery. These use cases can be used to better understand which chart to use for what kind of data.

## Hierarchical Layout
    
This chart is suitable for displaying hierarchical relationships. For example, the Red Cross might use it to illustrate the organizational structure of its various branches at different levels (national, regional, local) or to show the hierarchical classification of disaster response teams.

## Force Directed Graph
    
Ideal for visualizing connections and relationships between entities. The Red Cross could use it to map out the network of collaborations between different aid organizations during disaster relief efforts, highlighting key partnerships and resource-sharing dynamics.

## Chord Diagram
    
Effective for illustrating relationships and flows between entities. The Red Cross could utilize it to demonstrate the flow of resources (such as funds, personnel, or supplies) between different regions or departments within the organization, showcasing the interconnectedness of various components.

## Stream Graph
    
Best for visualizing changes over time in multiple variables or categories. The Red Cross might use it to track the allocation of resources (e.g., funding, volunteers, aid distribution) across different regions over time, providing insights into evolving patterns and priorities in humanitarian assistance.

## Doughnut Chart
    
Useful for displaying proportions within a single categorical variable. The Red Cross could employ it to represent the distribution of funding across different program areas (e.g., disaster response, health services, community development), allowing stakeholders to see the relative allocation of resources at a glance.

## Heat Map
    
Ideal for representing data values in a matrix format. The Red Cross could utilize it to visualize the geographic distribution of various risk factors (e.g., natural hazards, health threats, socio-economic vulnerabilities) across different regions, helping prioritize areas for targeted interventions and preparedness efforts.

## Bar Chart
    
Great for comparing discrete categories or groups. The Red Cross might use it to compare the effectiveness of different types of interventions (e.g., health education programs, disaster preparedness campaigns, humanitarian aid projects) in terms of outcomes achieved or resources invested.

## Line Chart
    
Excellent for visualizing trends and changes over time. The Red Cross could employ it to track the prevalence of specific humanitarian crises (e.g., disease outbreaks, natural disasters, conflict situations) over time, allowing for trend analysis and forecasting of future needs.

## Bubble Chart
    
Effective for displaying relationships between three variables. The Red Cross could use it to visualize the impact of various interventions (e.g., vaccination campaigns, water sanitation projects, emergency shelter provision) by plotting indicators such as cost, coverage, and outcomes, facilitating decision-making and resource allocation based on evidence-based assessments.
