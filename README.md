# Deployment Manual

This repository contains a collection of chart components built using D3.js and React for the IFRC. The Chart Gallery allows you to explore different types of charts and visualize data in an interactive way.

## Getting Started

To run the Chart Gallery locally on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/srikarpeesapati22/IFRC7-2023-Data-Viz-GO.git
```
Navigate to the chart_gallery directory:

```bash

cd chart_gallery
```
Install dependencies using npm:

```bash

npm install
```
Start the development server:

```bash

npm start
```
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the Chart Gallery.

## Usage

Explore different chart components by navigating through the Chart Gallery. Click on the buttons to see the dashboard and the individual charts.

Try resizing the window and trying this on multiple devices to see how the charts automatically resize themselves when the window size changes.

## Understanding How the Components Work

Navigate to [docs.md](docs.md) if you want to see how one of the components was built in great detail. The documentation contains a detailed description of how the BarChartComponent was built and this can be used as a template to create your own charts.

## Understanding Use Cases of Each Type of Chart

Navigate to [literature.md](literature.md) for further information on use cases for the charts shown in the chart gallery.
